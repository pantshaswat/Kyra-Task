# Implementing Automated Patch Tracking with Dependabot

This document outlines the process for configuring and managing automated dependency scanning and patch tracking for the **CampusWatch** project using GitHub Dependabot.

##  Overview

The goal of this implementation is to automatically detect known security vulnerabilities in our project's dependencies and streamline the process of applying security patches. We will use two core GitHub features:

1. **Dependabot Alerts:** Scans the repository for dependencies with known vulnerabilities and creates alerts in the "Security" tab.
2. **Dependabot Security Updates:** Automatically creates pull requests (PRs) to update vulnerable dependencies to the minimum patched version.

### Why GitHub Dependabot Was Chosen
After evaluating various patch tracking solutions, GitHub Dependabot was selected for the following reasons:

#### Technical Advantages

- Native GitHub Integration: Seamlessly integrates with our existing GitHub-based development workflow
- Comprehensive Database Coverage: Leverages GitHub Advisory Database, which aggregates data from multiple sources including:

  - National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
  - npm Security advisories
  - RubyGems.org advisories
  - Python Package Index (PyPI) advisories
  - Maven Central security advisories



#### Automation & Efficiency

- Zero Infrastructure Overhead: No need to maintain separate vulnerability scanning servers or databases
- Automated PR Creation: Automatically generates pull requests with security fixes
- CI/CD Integration: Works seamlessly with our existing test automation pipeline
- Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitors dependencies without manual intervention

#### Cost & Maintenance Benefits

- Free for Public Repositories: No additional licensing costs
- Minimal Configuration: Simple YAML-based setup with sensible defaults
- Low Maintenance: GitHub handles database updates and vulnerability intelligence

## Prerequisites

* The CampusWatch project code must be hosted in a GitHub repository.
* You must have **admin access** to the repository to change settings.

## Implementation Steps

The setup process involves enabling features in the GitHub UI and adding an optional configuration file for more control.

### Step 1: Enable Dependabot in the GitHub UI

1. Navigate to the CampusWatch repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. In the left sidebar, go to **Code security and analysis**.
4. Find "Dependabot" in the list and click **Enable** for the following features:
   * **Dependabot alerts:** This activates the vulnerability scanning. GitHub will start analyzing your `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, etc., and populate the **Security > Dependabot alerts** tab with any findings.
   * **Dependabot security updates:** This authorizes Dependabot to automatically create pull requests to fix the alerts it finds.

### Step 2: Add the Custom Configuration File

For more precise control over what Dependabot does, add the `dependabot.yml` configuration file.

1. In your repository's root, create a directory named `.github`.
2. Inside `.github`, create a file named `dependabot.yml`.
3. Add your custom configuration to the `dependabot.yml` file.
4. **Customize the file:** Change `github-username` to the actual GitHub username of the team lead or person responsible for reviewing these updates.
5. Commit and push this file to your main branch. Dependabot will now use this configuration for its checks.

## Workflow for Handling Dependabot Updates

Once configured, Dependabot will start creating pull requests. The team's workflow for handling them should be:

1. **Notification:** A developer (the assigned reviewer) gets notified that Dependabot has created a new pull request.
2. **Review the PR:** Open the pull request. Dependabot provides excellent context:
   * It links to the vulnerability advisory.
   * It includes the library's release notes.
   * It shows a "compatibility score" to indicate the likelihood of the update causing breaking changes.
3. **Check CI Tests:** Our automated test suite (CI/CD) will automatically run against the pull request. **This is the most important step.** If all tests pass, the update is likely safe to merge.
4. **Merge:** If the tests are green and the release notes don't mention any significant manual changes needed, merge the pull request.
5. **Monitor:** After the change is deployed, briefly monitor the application to ensure everything is working as expected.

## Verification

You can confirm the system is working correctly by:

* Visiting the **Security > Dependabot alerts** tab in your repository. You should see a list of any vulnerable dependencies.
* Checking the **Pull Requests** tab. You will see PRs opened by the `dependabot` user.
* After merging a fix, the corresponding alert in the Security tab will be automatically marked as resolved.

## Configuration Example

Here's a basic `dependabot.yml` configuration file structure:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm" # or package manager
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    reviewers:
      - "github-username"
```

## Troubleshooting

* **No alerts appearing:** Ensure the repository contains dependency files that Dependabot can scan (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Gemfile`).
* **Pull requests not being created:** Verify that both Dependabot alerts and security updates are enabled in the repository settings.
* **Configuration not working:** Check that the `dependabot.yml` file is properly formatted and located in the `.github` directory.
